Hi! I am an old hospital pharmacist 75 years in 2021!

My first computer was a PDP 8/e from DEC (Digital Equipment Corp)... with 4K memory  of 12 bits words!

Today I have  home network, Windows 10 computer with 3 screens , a Macbook Air and a Synology NAS in the garage..;

Actually I am learning Python 3.7 not so diferent from "Focal" the interpreter language available on the PDP8!

I open a GitHub account by the way of a "debloatter"... I find MS add so much unusefull stuff I want to be rid off!
